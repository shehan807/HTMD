This folder contains a library of water models. LigParGen only created OPLS-AA
parameters for organic molecules, which would resulted in possibly inaccurate 
water parameters since it isn't organic. Instead, the user may select from a 
number of water models (with the default set to TIP4P).

**NOTE:** These files have been modified to match the 1-4 scaling values in 
the NonbondedForce class (i.e., changed from 0.83333 -> 0.5)
