NOTE: The TI codes included in this directory are specifically for OPLS 
simulations in which the xml file (generated by ligpargen) does not 
contain CustomNonbondedForces. Instead, when creating an OPLS system, 
the `OPLS_LJ(system)` is used to take care of geometric combination rules. 

See line 558 in TI_classes.py for a hard-coded creation of OPLS geometric 
combination rules (i.e., for any other force field that uses typical 
Lorentz-Berenthal combination rules or actually requires SAPT nonbonded 
terms, remove this line!).
