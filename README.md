# Molecular Dynamics Workflow

# Overview 
This directory contains all updated scripts relevant in basic thermophysical and structural analysis 
of ionic liquids. The directory organization is kept in summary.txt and created by running 
`python summary.py'. 

# To-do 
[ ] create dataset workflow to save analysis into ML/AI-readable (e.g., SQL?)
[ ] high throughput MD workflow (Galaxy, Materials Project)
[ ] snakemake slurm workflow
[ ] charge fitting automation
[ ] implement polymerized ILs
[ ] clean up TI code for OPLS generality and remove excess/redundant code
[ ] benchmark IL TI calculations for # of H2O molecules and eq. time

# Doing
[ ] compare OPLS with SAPT FF

# Done
